# REALESTATE

Hey, I tried to sent you a DM but reddit not allowed me to do it. So here goes:

I'm a developer, and I'm currently building an application that transforms Zillow listings into high conversion landing pages powered by AI. The whole idea is to help agents showcase properties in a way that actually converts browsers into genuine leads, which I know is always the main pain point.

Besides that, I figured we could explore whether there's something valuable I could help you with on the technical side. Whether it's integrating new tools, optimizing workflows, or building custom solutions for your specific needs, I'm pretty flexible and always up for interesting projects around the real estate tech space. No pressure at all. Thanks!
